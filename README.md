# Simple_TCP/IP_Server
* This is the simple Tcp-Ip server written in c#.net
* in this what server will do is that
      - first it listen to the incoming requests
      - Gets the data from client
      - Process the data ( here processing is simple i.e Convering all the data into upper case letters )
      - Sends the data to client.


* Now this server is able to handle more than one client at time.
